# MedicalPlus
Ionic Project

## Installation to current Ionic Project
1. Install git at https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. On your CLI `git clone https://github.com/jc4balos/MedicalPlus.git`
3. Rename to src (I'll fix this later so you won't have to do it)
4. Copy src to existing ionic project
5. `ionic serve` on directory of ionic project
